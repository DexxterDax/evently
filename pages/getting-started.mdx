# Getting Started

## Installation

To start using Evently in your project, you first need to install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @rbxts/evently
```

## Defining Events

Use the `EventDefinitions` function to create an event system with strongly typed event definitions. Define your event names and their corresponding data types in a single object.

Example:

```typescript
import EventDefinitions from "@rbxts/evently";

interface Test {
    roblox: string;
    game: number;
}

const events = EventDefinitions<{
    foo: Test;
}>();
```

## Registering Handlers

Use the `on` method to register handlers for specific events.

```typescript
events.on("foo", (data) => {
    print(`Game: ${data.game}, Roblox: ${data.roblox}`);
});
```

## Triggering Events

To fire an event and pass data to the handlers, use the `trigger` method:

```typescript
events.trigger("foo", {
    roblox: "roblox",
    game: 123,
});
```
